A Northstar Riff for a silly smart pistol gamemode.

- All guns (primary, secondary, anti-titan) are removed, and you are given a smart pistol.
- Cloak is banned, it gets replaced by stim. You can run, but you can't hide!
- Getting a kill fully restores the smart pistol's ammo reserve (you will still have to reload though)
- Everyone only has 1 HP, meaning any damage is fatal. Additionally, the smart pistol locks on to players as fast as it does grunts!
- Ordinance is replaced with pulse blade. Pulse blade pilots are given grapple.

## Installation
1. On the main page click `Code`, then `Download ZIP`
2. Open the ZIP file, and extract the folder inside to your mods folder (`/Titanfall2/R2Northstar/mods`)
3. Reload your mods, or restart the game

If you did all that right, there should be an option in private lobby settings under `Riffs` to enable the mode. Have fun!
It is also entirely server-side, clients don't need to download or install anything!
